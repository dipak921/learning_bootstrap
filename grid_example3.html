                            <p>Varun, a military doctor working in the Indian Army Medical Corps, is a strict and practical person. While returning from a mission, he receives a voicemail from his fiancée, Padmini, who urges him to cancel their wedding. While inquiring about her change of heart with her family, Padmini belittles him for being emotionally distant and apathetic. While leaving, Varun and Padmini's family learn that Chinnu, Padmini's niece, has gone missing. The family complains to the police– who in turn appoint Bhagat, a low-ranking police officer, to monitor the family's communications. Disillusioned with the police's progress, Varun plots to kidnap the assistant commissioner's daughter, believing that the resulting investigation will be more competent. His plan works, and the police nab almost every major criminal related to child kidnapping. Varun singles out three criminals – Kamala Kannan, Kamesh, and Pratap – who he noticed were around Chinnu's school at the time of her disappearance.</p>
